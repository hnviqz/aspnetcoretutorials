### Attribute Routing vs Conventional Routing in ASP.NET Core

In this article, I will discuss Attribute Routing vs Conventional Routing in ASP.NET Core MVC Applications with Examples. Please read our previous article discussing ASP.NET Core Attribute Routing using Tokens with Examples.

### Conventional Routing in ASP.NET Core
Conventional routing uses a predefined pattern to map requests to controller actions. It involves defining routes in the Program.cs file. This approach relies on a predefined pattern to match the URL paths to the corresponding controller actions. It typically specifies placeholders for the controller name, action name, and optional parameters. This approach is useful for applications with a clear and consistent URL structure across the entire application.

### Characteristics of Conventional Routing:

- Routes are defined globally in a centralized location, typically in the Program.cs file.
- It implicitly uses route templates associated with controllers and actions through naming conventions.
- Parameters can be specified within the route templates to capture values from the URL.

#### Advantages of Conventional Routing:

- Simplifies route management by centralizing route definitions, making it easier to understand and manage the application’s URL structure.
- Ideal for large applications with a hierarchical URL structure that follows a consistent pattern.


#### Disadvantages of Conventional Routing:

- Less flexible in defining granular or action-specific routes directly on controllers or actions.
- This can lead to more complex route management in highly dynamic URL pattern applications.

#### When to use Conventional Routing?

- **Large Applications with Standardized URL Patterns**: Conventional routing is ideal for large applications with many controllers and actions but standardized URL patterns. It reduces the need to decorate each action method with route attributes, keeping the code cleaner.
- **Centralized Route Configuration**: Conventional routing provides this advantage if you prefer to have routes defined and managed in a centralized location. It allows for easier changes to route patterns without modifying individual controllers or actions.
- **Simple CRUD Operations**: For applications that follow a straightforward CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) pattern, conventional routing can be more straightforward and less verbose than attribute routing.

#### Attribute Routing in ASP.NET Core

Attribute routing, introduced in later versions of ASP.NET, allows for more granular control over the URLs by defining routes directly on actions and controllers using attributes. This approach offers greater flexibility in defining routes, including specifying complex route patterns and constraints directly on the action methods or controllers.

#### Characteristics of Attribute Routing:

- Routes are defined using attributes on controllers and actions, allowing for detailed and customized route definitions.
- It offers greater flexibility in defining routes that do not follow a conventional pattern.
- Supports the definition of complex route templates, including using multiple parameters, constraints, and even dynamically generating URLs.
##### Advantages of Attribute Routing:
- Provides greater control and precision over routing, allowing for complex and custom route patterns that are not easily achieved with conventional routing.
- Facilitates the organization of routing logic by keeping it closer to the action methods it applies to, improving readability and maintainability.

##### Disadvantages of Attribute Routing:
- This can lead to a scattered routing configuration if not managed carefully, as routes are defined across different controllers and actions.
- It requires more effort to understand the routing configuration as it is not centralized.

#### When to use Attribute Routing:

Fine-grained URL Control: When you need precise control over your application’s URL patterns, attribute routing is the way to go. It’s particularly useful for designing RESTful APIs where URLs represent resources and operations on those resources.
Complex Route Patterns: Attribute routing shines when dealing with complex routes that conventional routing struggles with, such as routes that need to capture multiple parameters or have custom constraints.
Versioning APIs: For applications that involve API versioning, attribute routing makes it easier to define different routes for different API versions within the same application.
Mixing Static and Dynamic Segments: If you need to mix static URL segments with dynamic ones in a single route, attribute routing provides the flexibility to accomplish this easily.
The choice between attribute routing and conventional routing depends on your application’s specific needs. Conventional routing is often more suitable for applications that benefit from centralized route definitions and have a uniform URL structure. On the other hand, attribute routing is preferred for applications requiring detailed control over route configurations, such as APIs or applications with complex routing requirements. It’s also worth noting that ASP.NET Core supports combining both routing methods in the same application, allowing developers to choose the most appropriate routing strategy for each controller or action.
